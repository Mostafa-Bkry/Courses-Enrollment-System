# About 
- The Courses Enrollment System is  managing students and their enrollments in each course with different valuable features like course slots and managing student and course
information in an easy and fast way through CRUD operations.

- Important feature: When the student tries to enroll again in a course that he enrolled in before, the system ignores that operation.
- Important feature: When the student tries to enroll in a course that doesn't have any available slots, the system will ignore that operation until the course opens new slots.

# Setup Instructions
- Note: The project is only for testing because it uses an in-memory database, which doesn't save data permanently, and after application execution terminates, all data will be deleted from memory.
- To use this system, you only have to have an internet connection to get all client-side libraries.
